# Mario Pet Project

## Project Description

This Java project is a Super Mario Bros-themed virtual pet program that allows users to choose from four characters: Mario, Bowser, Wario, or Luigi. Each pet has core stats such as energy, happiness, and health, along with unique attributes. Users can interact with their chosen character through unique behaviors that can dynamically affect their pet's stats. 

## Run Instructions

How to run:

When the program begins, the user is prompted to choose one of four characters—Mario, Luigi, Bowser, or Wario—by entering the number that corresponds to their selection. After choosing a pet, the program displays all available behaviors and actions the character can perform. The user then selects an action, and the program updates the pet’s stats accordingly; these actions can improve or harm the pet’s well-being, and poor stat management may even lead to the pet’s death and the end of the program. At any point, the user also has the option to quit.


## Features

- Multiple pet character classes: `luigi`, `mario`, `wario`, `bowser`.
- Choose a pet character and call behaviors to modify stats (health, energy, happiness, scared level).
- Behaviors include finding mushrooms, exploring mansions, hitting question blocks, attacking Boos, and sleeping that are unique to the characters and match their personalities.
- Stats are clamped between 0 and 100.
