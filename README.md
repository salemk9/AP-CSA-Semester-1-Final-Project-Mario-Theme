# Mario Pet Project

## Project Description

This Java project is a Super Mario Bros-themed virtual pet program that allows users to choose from four characters: Mario, Bowser, Wario, or Luigi. Each pet has core stats such as energy, happiness, and health, along with unique attributes. Users can interact with their chosen character through unique behaviors that can dynamically affect their pet's stats. 

## Run Instructions

How to run:

When the program is first run, the user is prompted to choose from four characters: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Wario. After typing the number corresponding to the pet/character they choose, the user is shown all the behaviors and actions their pet can do. Then, the user types the nume=ber corresponding to the behavior they want their pet to perform, which affects the stats and attributes of their pet. The stats of the pet can benefit from these actions, but can also be harmed, which may lead to the pet's death and the end of the program. If the user ever desires, they can quit at any time.


## Features

- Multiple pet character classes: `luigi`, `mario`, `wario`, `bowser`.
- Choose a pet character and call behaviors to modify stats (health, energy, happiness, scared level).
- Behaviors include finding mushrooms, exploring mansions, hitting question blocks, attacking Boos, and sleeping that are unique to the characters and match their personalities.
- Stats are clamped between 0 and 100.
